# ONFI Spec Analysis Part 3: ONFI 5.1 and the Future of NV-LPDDR4

The final part of our series explores the cutting edge: ONFI 5.1. This version is designed for enterprise SSDs requiring massive throughput and mobile devices needing extreme power efficiency.

## 1. NV-LPDDR4 Interface
The biggest leap in ONFI 5.x is the introduction of the **NV-LPDDR4** interface.
- It enables speeds up to **2400MT/s** and beyond.
- Uses low-voltage signaling to maintain performance while reducing heat.

## 2. Command Set Extensions
To support high-capacity QLC NAND, ONFI 5.1 introduces refined command sets for:
- **Multi-plane operations**: Parallelizing reads and writes across NAND planes.
- **Asynchronous independent blocks**: Reducing latency in mixed workloads.
