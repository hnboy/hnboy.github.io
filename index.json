比较器设计用于大差分输入电压，而运算放大器一般用于驱动闭环系统，在负反馈的作用下，其输入电压差降至非常低.当运算放大器过载时候，有时候几毫伏也可能导致过载，其中有些放大级可能发生饱和。这种情况下，器件要相对较长的时候从饱和中恢复，如果发生饱和，其速度将慢很多。 现代运算放大器多采用轨到轨输出，其最大正电平接近正电源，最低负电平接近负电源。(老式设计所用架构的两个供电轨都具有1.5 V以上的动态余量。) 如果逻辑和运算放大器共用同一电源，轨到轨运算放大器可成功驱动CMOS和TTL逻辑系列，但是，如果运算放大器和逻辑采用不同电源，则需在两者之间另外设置接口电路。注意，这种情况采用于采用±5 V电源的运算放大器，必须用+5 V电源驱动逻辑；如果施加-5 V电源，则可能损坏逻辑。 最简单的接口电路就是变换器，可能以NPN晶体管制成，但这些元件需会基极吸取电流。更为方便的是N-沟道MOSFET晶体管。如下图所示 1.png RB设定晶体管基极电流，RL则设定集电极/漏极的电流。该电流越小，变换器速度就越快，但其功耗也越大。通常使用几千欧姆的数值。N-沟道MOS器件应采用低栅极阈值电压(\u003c2 V)和高于运算放大器最大输出电压的栅源击穿电压。一般±25 V就够了。尽管运算放大器和逻辑使用不同的电源，但必须相互连接。运算放大器正电源+VA必须比逻辑负电源-VL高至少3 V，才能提供足够电压来开启晶体管或MOSFET栅极。另外，运算放大器负电源相对于逻辑负电源不能为正，但可与其相连。当然，必须遵循全部所用器件的绝对最大额定值。 补充MOS变换器可采用一个P-沟道和一个N-沟道MOSFET。这样做的优势在于没有待机电流，但在切换过程中，两个器件同时开启时会产生大电流尖峰。在这种设计中，运算放大器正电源+VA必须等于或大于逻辑正电源+VL。另外，运算放大器负电源必须等于或小于逻辑负电源。如下图所示 2.png

积分电路计算 电路如下图所示 写出输入与输出关系； 若$u_1=+1V$，电容器两端初始电压$u_c=0$，求：输出电压$u_o$变为0V所需要的时间。 解：有图可知，图中$A_1$为积分器，$A_2$为反向加法器，所以可以推出： $$u_{o1}=-\\frac{1}{RC}\\int_{t0}^{t1}u_1,\\mathrm{d}t+u_c\\mid_{t0=0}$$ $$u_0=-u_{01}-u_1$$ (2) 因$\\begin{smallmatrix}u_c\\mid_{t0=0}=0,u_1=+1V\\end{smallmatrix}$则 $$u_o=\\frac{u_1}{RC}t_1-u_1=0$$ 故$$t_1=RC=10S$$
