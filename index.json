At these frequencies, transmission line effects like signal reflection can completely close the data eye diagram. On-Die Termination (ODT) is the critical hardware mechanism designed to mitigate these effects.

The Physics of ReflectionWhen a high-speed signal reaches the end of a transmission line (the NAND die), any impedance mismatch between the PCB trace (typically 50Ω) and the high-impedance input buffer causes the signal to reflect back. This creates “ringing” and “intersymbol interference (ISI),” eroding the tDS (Data Setup) and tDH (Data Hold) margins.
